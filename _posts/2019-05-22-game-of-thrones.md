So, Game of Thrones ended!

The last couple of episodes are still pretty fresh in my mind, so they run the risk of influencing my opinion of the entire show - possibly rightly so, given that the end is a pretty important part of any story - but, on balance, what the cast and crew have managed to pull off these last eight years is an absolute achievement. When David Benioff and Dan Weiss had the books to draw from, they managed to condense GRRM's dense writing into taught, hour long episodes that capture the essence of the story, sticking to what works and discarding what doesn't, even occasionally inventing their own scenes to more fully explore certain characters.

When they no longer had the books to draw from, it didn't work so well, but they tried hard to present a version of GRRM's (in progress) conclusion that would do justice to the story that they (and GRRM) have been telling all these years. That they managed to come up with something that just about holds together is commendable.

## Ours is the Fury

That said, I'm in the same camp as a lot of the internet seems to be, in that I'm pretty disappointed with how things actually turned out. Pacing was a slight issue; suddenly trips that would take characters several episodes to make in earlier seasons were now being completed multiple times in a single episode. That's a nitpick though, while the story still makes sense, it doesn't really matter.

What I have more of an issue with is some of the choices that were made to allow the series to get to its end point faster, like allowing the entire White Walker threat, one that had been built up since the very first episode, to be completely eradicated by one well placed thrust of a dagger. Perhaps GRRM envisions things occurring similarly in the books, but given the Night King doesn't exist as a character there, I have to imagine it won't be so convenient.

Then you have Dany going full mad queen - I completely understand that she was in despair at losing most of the people she trusted and loved most in the world, including two of her dragons, and I understand that she's had a bit of a temper at times. However, her anger had previously always been directed at those who had in some way oppressed either her or the people she was trying to liberate. She was like The Punisher, she had a code, a vicious one, but a code nonetheless. For her to decide that the best way to get back at Cersei is to burn an entire city full of innocents just didn't ring true, especially the opportunity was there for her to fly straight at Cersei in the Red Keep and rain destruction on that one, isolated part of the city.

## Bran did it

The more I think about the final season, the more I'm convinced Bran/The Three-Eyed Raven was manipulating things behind the scenes with the express purpose of claiming the throne, for a few reasons:

- Time travel

We know Bran can basically see through time, he was there at Jon's birth, he saw the creation of the White Walkers, and he messed a young Hodor's head up. He also alludes, several times, to knowing the future. He mentions that he's "waiting for an old friend" in the courtyard of Winterfell, then later Jaime Lannister arrives, Jaime of course having not seen Bran since he pushed him out of a window and crippled him. In the very last episode, when offered the position of king, he replies "why do you think I travelled all this way?". He knew it was going to happen.

- Warging

We've seen Bran, on numerous occasions, directly take control of both animals and humans for his own ends. He warged into Hodor repeatedly (poor bloke), and he's controlled wolves and birds when he's had to. He's also controlled birds when he seemingly hasn't had to, as he did during the battle of Winterfell as his fellow humans fought and gave their lives all around him. I still don't understand what he was trying to achieve by having those birds get all up in the Night King's grill.

- He's not Bran anymore

We don't know who Bran is now. Bran was made The Three-Eyed Raven (3ER), but we've absolutely no idea what his/its motivation is, other than that he doesn't get on with the White Walkers.

The time travel factor alone gives me reason to think Bran/3ER was gunning for the throne all along - if we accept that he knows the future, then it follows that he knew of and could have prevented any of these things, if only to avert the massacre that occurred in King's Landing:

- that Euron's ships would be lying in wait to pick one of Dany's dragons out of the sky
- that Missandei would be captured by Euron's forces, and then executed in front of Dany
- that Dany would go absolutely berserk in reaction to the above two events, as soon as she realised she had the upper hand

Bran could have easily, _easily_ pointed out that they really needed to keep an eye out for an entire fleet of ships. He could just as easily have also said to Missandei and/or Grey Worm that it would be a really good idea to have her go with the army that were travelling to King's Landing on land. He could have _especially_ easily said to literally anybody in Winterfell besides Jon Snow that the dragon queen they didn't trust was going to commit an atrocity that would put every other evil character in the show to shame, and hey, maybe just do everyone a solid and either lock her up or take her out.

He didn't do any of these things, and he must have known what was going to happen. That means he _let it happen_. In my opinion that is much, much worse than Dany snapping, because she chose to do something horrific in the moment, while Bran had enough foreknowledge that he could engineer events to prevent Dany making that choice, and didn't, meaning _he_ made a calculated choice to let those people burn, which would ultimately lead to him ruling six kingdoms.

## In conclusion

To sum up: Game of Thrones had a great beginning and middle, and an ending so rushed that my imagination filled in some blanks and I'm now convinced Bran/3ER is a super-powered psychopath.
