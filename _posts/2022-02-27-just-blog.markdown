Here it goes - the awkward first blog post I always struggle to write anytime I think about getting back into blogging again, before instead spending all my time tweaking the template (with dummy content, of course) and ultimately never actually writing anything.

Not this time! This time I'm gonna drag my lazy arse out of my procrastination hole and just power through - it's been a while since I wrote anything for _me_, I used to journal a lot in my early twenties, and it was good for articulating the thoughts I had rattling around in my head, and getting them off my chest.

I have WAY more thoughts rattling around in there now, and it's way past time I got them out, cos... ugh, it's been a crazy few years. Anyway, we'll get into that in good time. The plan is to blog at least once a week - about absolutely anything. It's gonna go all over the map, sometimes the post will be focussed on a particular subject, other times it'll be a stream of consciousness - I don't really have a plan, beyond "blog _at all_".

It's now very late (I was again tweaking the template and it got to midnight without me realising), so I will call it a night, and return soon with A Proper Post About Something Real.
