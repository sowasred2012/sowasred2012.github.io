Hi!

My name is Scott Mason Nash, I'm a front-end developer, and this is my blog.

I'll be posting about whatever I'm in the mood to write about, but I expect the majority of posts will concern one of the following:

- front-end development
- films
- video games
- baking

Feel free to get in touch if anything you read here motivates you to!
