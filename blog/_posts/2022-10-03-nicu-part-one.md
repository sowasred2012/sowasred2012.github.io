It was a lazy summer's eve in 2019, and we'd just finished the penultimate episode of the third season of Stranger Things - it was a cracking episode! Jen and I sat talking excitedly about what had just happened, and what the finale might bring when all of a sudden-

> "Whoah, that was a hell of a kick!"

That's when it started. Jen, my wife, was 31 weeks and 4 days pregnant, and that "kick" was actually her waters breaking. Luckily, we'd packed our hospital bag literally two days beforehand, so we grabbed that, called to let the hospital know that we were coming, and drove straight there. We had no idea what we were in for.

## The birth

What I want to do with this series of posts is highlight the experiences we had in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), good and bad, and praise the many, many doctors, nurses, therapists, consultants and administrators that we encountered during our time in several different NICUs. However, the birth happened on the maternity ward, and writing about what happened that night would make this a much different, much longer, much angrier post, and... I'm not ready for that yet. Not out in the open. Maybe one day.

That said, I can't talk about NICUs without talking about why our son, Oliver, had to be in one (three, in total); in addition to being born two months premature, Oliver was born without a heartbeat, and needed resuscitation - several minutes worth. He also had a laceration extending all the way around the left side of his chest, an injury sustained during a crash C-section.

It still breaks my heart that that's the way he entered into the world, but again, this post is not about that.

## Our first NICU

After the birth, Oliver was taken straight up to the NICU. Jen was recovering in the maternity ward, and a consultant from the NICU came to talk to us - I can honestly say this was the first time I'd even heard the term "NICU", oblivious to the fact that it was about to become both part of our daily vocabulary, and where we would spend almost all of our time for the next few months.

The consultant spoke with us for quite a while, she mentioned he'd had seizures that they were giving him medication to help control, she talked about the resuscitation he'd needed. I was really naive in that moment and had no real understanding of what half the stuff she said could mean, all I heard was "Oliver is alive".

### Meeting Oliver

The nature of the birth meant I wasn't allowed to be present during the moment he actually arrived, so the first time I was able to lay eyes on Oliver was up there in the NICU, without Jen, who was recovering two floors below us in the maternity ward. He was in an incubator, on a ventilator with a tube down his throat, wires and tubes were everywhere, the laceration on his chest had a dressing on it, and there were lots of people around him getting him settled in, if you can call it settled.

It was overwhelming to finally see him - this tiny, 1.8kg human who, on his first _day_, had gone through an ordeal bigger than anything I've ever faced in my life. He was, and still is, a little warrior.

The next few hours are a complete blur - there was a lot of running up and down stairs juggling being with Oliver and Jen in different parts of the hospital, until eventually we were all able to be in the same room together after campaigning for a wheelchair. We also were told that Oliver was going to be transferred to Chelsea + Westminster (C+W) NICU as soon as possible because they had a great team of plastic surgeons who would be able to stitch up the laceration on his chest.

There was a moment where the maternity ward were seriously entertaining the idea of having Jen stay put in the hospital, while Oliver and I went to another hospital on the other side of the city - on the one hand you could see their reasoning; Jen had just had major, emergency surgery and needed to heal, but on the other, the thought of being so far away from Oliver was obviously extremely distressing for Jen.

Thankfully, there was a student midwife who came in on the morning shift to look after Jen, and when she heard what was potentially happening, she went up and spoke to a senior nurse on the NICU about it. That nurse didn't even blink, she almost immediately arranged for Jen to be transferred the same day. Phew!

### The neonatal transfer team

The [neonatal transfer team](https://london-nts.nhs.uk/) arrived in the early hours of the morning, with a portable incubator that looked like something out of a 70's sci-fi film. It took a good amount of time making sure all of the equipment was setup and checked before they were ready to move Oliver into it, which I actually found reassuring.

By this point, I hadn't slept in 36 hours, so I was running on adrenaline and still somehow not really realising how massive what we were going through was. There was always something going on, a next step, an objective to be completed, an imminent ETA for one thing or another. Jen was resting downstairs at this point, so I was with Oliver in the NICU, watching them prepare all of this equipment.

The transfer team were absolutely lovely people, talked me through everything that was happening and was going to happen, and when they were ready to move him, we took the elevator down, and wheeled Oliver out to their ambulance while Jen saw us off.

It was rush hour by the time the ambulance was ready to leave, but the sirens went on and we absolutely floored it across the city - it was the first time I'd ever ridden in an ambulance with the lights on, and it was truly _awesome_. The team even gave Oliver his first cuddly toy, a crocheted stork. I really can't speak highly enough of them, they were superstars.

## Our second NICU: Chelsea + Westminster

We were there in almost no time, I couldn't believe it was physically possible to cross half the city in such a short time. We entered the hospital via the ambulance crew's entrance, and were taken straight up to the NICU there. At this point, I was told I couldn't be in the room while Oliver was transferred from the portable incubator to the one in the room, so I had to go and wait in the parent's room.

It was pretty tiny, but there were three faux leather, light blue sofas in there, with a window that looked out into the atrium of the hospital. There was also a tiny kitchen, with a fridge, a sink, a kettle, and free coffee. I called my wife to see how she was getting on, and to my surprise, she was in transit! The ambulance was about ten minutes away, and then she'd be taken up to the maternity ward. I collapsed onto one of the sofas, and shut my eyes for a few minutes.

### Parent's rooms

Parent's rooms are little islands in the world of NICU where you can take a few minutes away from the reality of the situation your child is facing 24/7 until they're discharged. It almost makes you feel guilty being in there, like, how _dare_ you take five minutes to have a coffee or a nap while they're fighting with everything they've got in the other room?

You need the time away though, and the parent's room is as close as you can be while still giving yourself that space to decompress, recharge and pull yourself together.

I met another parent in that room shortly after we arrived, and now that I think about it, her attitude towards the situation she and her child were in probably fundamentally shaped my own. Her child was in the NICU, opposite Oliver, and they'd already been there for some time.

Nevertheless, she was full of optimism, of hope, she laughed a lot, she told jokes, she asked about Oliver, she told us about her situation, imparted lots of wisdom - and she did all that while clearly having a grasp on the reality of the situation. I think that's what had the biggest impact on me, that even as bad as things got, it _was_ possible to be positive, without being delusional or unrealistic (I also discovered a video on [stoicism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKfUK1Gd6YM&ab_channel=BigThink) at some point during this whole experience that helped reinforce the idea that I could choose not to let this overwhelm me, and instead try to find the way forward).

### The next three weeks

With Jen now in the maternity ward at C+W, things calmed down significantly, though there was always a lot happening.

Jen spent a week or so recovering from the C-section on the maternity ward, and it was a straight line down a long corridor from her ward to the NICU, where Oliver was in his incubator, so it was easy to just grab a wheelchair and spend time together as a family - albeit surrounded by machines beeping and alarming at things we didn't understand yet.

Oliver was seen by a plastic surgeon relatively quickly, I think it was the day after we arrived. He assessed the laceration on his chest and was, incredibly, quite chill about the whole thing. He performed the procedure the next morning, and that was that!

After that, it sort of settled into a routine: we spent as much time as we could with Oliver, reading to him, talking to him, and we eventually, finally got to hold him for the first time.

![Us, holding Oliver](/assets/holding.jpg)

We also fired an endless amount of questions at each of his nurses while we tried to understand his situation better and learn what all the equipment did and what all the numbers and lights and sounds meant. Every single one of the nurses was really gracious and patient with us, and took the time to answer every questions we could think to ask, though I'm 100% certain they get the same questions a lot and would rather be focussing on their patient than their patient's bewildered parents.

Things seemed relatively calm, we were in our routine, so we started exploring the hospital a little bit and found that they had a cinema run by a brilliant charity, [Medicinema](https://www.medicinema.org.uk/), who set up cinemas in hospitals, and invite patients to come and see a surprisingly current selection of films for free. They extended the invite to NICU parents, so we went along to a screening of [Yesterday](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(2019_film)>), and after what had happened in the couple of weeks prior, it was such a joy to be sitting in a cinema, escaping for an hour or two with a decent, feel good film.

It helped us recharge our batteries a little bit, and we were in such a good mood afterwards. I've always found the cinema to be - obviously, with the right film - a powerful experience, but what Medicinema does is properly special.

### Jen

I'm writing this post from my own point of view and these four months were, by a long way, the hardest experience of my life. Even so, it doesn't compare to what Jen went through. Recovering from a C-section is no joke as it is, but add to that the stress that goes with your baby lying in an incubator in another part of the hospital while you can barely move, plus the pressure to constantly express milk every few hours so that it can later be given to your baby through a tube - it's a lot!

As time went on, my paternity leave dried up and I had to return to work (more on that later) so, for me, it was like I had this little escape from the situation for a few hours a day, 5 days a week. Jen was there _every single day_, unless she was physically ill. She absorbed every scrap of information a consultant, therapist, doctor or nurse ever gave her, took copious notes, wrote up medicine schedules, decorated Oliver's incubator, maintained a regular expressing schedule, questioned any new term or acronym, and quickly became an authority on Oliver's care. I could keep the ship afloat in Jen's absence, but she was - and still is! - unquestionably its captain.

### Crash

At 31 weeks, a baby's lungs aren't quite fully developed, so they usually need extra help with breathing until the lungs have had a chance to catch up. Again, I didn't fully understand this at the time, so when the staff announced Oliver had a collapsed lung, I freaked all the way out for about five seconds until they explained that it wasn't uncommon for that to happen in prem babies at this stage, and that they'd just need to tweak his ventilation to help reinflate the lung again. It was successful, so a little while later his ventilation tube was removed, and he was put on a less intense form of ventilation called [CPAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_positive_airway_pressure).

Babies born so early can't be breast fed until they're somewhere around 34 weeks, so they had to feed Oliver via what's known as a nasogastric (NG) tube, which is a thin tube that runs up a baby's nose and into their stomach. Jen would go and express every few hours, they'd store the milk, and then he'd be fed through this tube a few times a day. This worked really well for a while, Oliver put on weight, and was doing well enough that we got to hold him for the first time a few days into his stay there.

Jen was discharged, and we found a really basic Airbnb near the hospital so we could stay close to Oliver. Oliver was doing well enough that he was transferred from the NICU to the High Dependency Unit (HDU). There are three "tiers" of care in a neonatal unit, and each one represents a stepdown in the intensity of care needed, so NICU is the most intense, HDU is for babies who are doing well but have a little way to go, and then finally there's the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), where babies are mostly just monitored for a short amount of time before being discharged if everything went well.

With Oliver being transferred to HDU, we both took it in our stride, with confidence - of course he was "graduating"! We'd all be home before long, probably some time around his due date, so he'd do a bit of time in HDU, and pretty soon he'd be in SCBU. That was the dream, anyway.

I'd run out of paternity leave, so I was working from the Starbucks next to the hospital. One day, my phone rang, and it was the hospital - my first thought was panic; NICU staff tend not to ring unless there's been some sort of event, but in this case, they were ringing to tell us that they thought Oliver's ventilation should be increased, and they were going to intubate him again. We'd been told this might happen, that Oliver might need more help occasionally while he was getting used to his lungs doing more of the work, so we were ready for that. Jen was having lunch with a friend - a rare break for her - so I stopped what I was doing and went up to be with him.

Almost as soon as I entered the neonatal ward, alarms started going off all over the place, and the staff were all running towards the NICU. It was the alarm that goes off when a baby is "crashing", a term used when a baby is suddenly in immediate danger. I was scared, I followed everyone into the NICU, and was horrified when I saw it was Oliver they were rushing towards.

What had happened was, while intubating Oliver, he'd refluxed his food, blocking the tube, and causing him to choke. For the second time, he was fighting for his life. Luckily, and with all thanks to the amazing NICU staff, Oliver recovered from the incident very quickly, but it's a fucking horrible thing to witness your child go through and to also know that, you, their parent, are the least useful person in the room at that moment.

I sat helpless, just watching this incredible team save his life and, when it was all over, they came and comforted _me_! I was a mess; they were legends.

#### Working from the hospital

I had started a new job at <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> two months before Oliver was born, so hadn't really even had the time to properly ingratiate myself and get to know everyone when everything hit the fan.

Even so, the understanding and empathy the team I work with showed me from the get go was incredible, and once my paternity leave was over, they agreed without hesitation to let me continue working remotely from the hospital, never batting an eye if I suddenly had to go AWOL to deal with an emergency, like the crash. It's something I'll be forever grateful for.

### On the mend again

After that little nightmare episode, things got stable again. Oliver graduated to the HDU again, and they started gradually weaning down his ventilation over the course of a few days, to a lighter flow while his lungs started to do more of the work. He remained stable, and so it came time for C+W to transfer him back to his birth hospital. They'd been so good to us, we'd have loved to have stayed, but they had a waiting list for beds and there were patients from a number of other hospitals that needed the skills they specialised in.

When the transfer team came, I was so happy to see that the person driving the ambulance was the same person who'd driven us here - we were in good hands.

To be continued!
